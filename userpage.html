                    <p>I learn that every product needs to start with a strong <strong>WHY</strong>,
                    this strong why should lead to a disruptive and inspireing vision which you need to share with co-founders / co-workers, 
                    investors this will create a DNA & cultre, which will make customerser want to buy your product. <br>
                    successful founding is all about finding the why</p>

                    <p>I learned that failing is a critical part of learning, and that you want to try and fail as much as possible. <br>
                        In practice this means building and launching an <strong>MVP</strong> (minium viable product) to text your business 
                        thesis and learn from real customers as soon as possible.

                    <p>My biggest takeaway was that you don't need to build the next unicorn to be considered successful you just need to 
                        build a profitable aka. sustainable business which makes enough to fund your living and keeps you excited to continue 
                        to work on it</p>
